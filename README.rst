**Imanage** is a conference planning tool focused on providing the best
experience for organisers, speakers, reviewers, and attendees alike.  It
handles the submission process with a configurable Call for Participation, the
reviewing and selection of submissions, and the scheduling and release
handling. After the event, Imanage allows speakers to receive feedback, upload
their slides, and organisers to embed recordings.

Read our `feature list`_ on our main site to get a better idea of what Imanage
can do for you, but it typically involves everything you'll need to curate
submissions and contents for a conference with several tracks and conference
days.

You can host Imanage yourself, as detailed in our `administrator
documentation`_, or use our public instance at `imanage.com`_. If you want to
use Imanage, we recommend you follow `our blog`_, where we announce new
versions and upcoming features.

🚀 Quick Start with Docker
---------------------------

The fastest way to get iManage running locally is with Docker:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/LenTech010/iManage.git
   cd iManage
   ./run_all.sh

This will start the complete application with:

* **Backend (Django)**: http://localhost:8000
* **Frontend (Vite)**: http://localhost:3000
* **PostgreSQL Database**: localhost:5432

Default admin credentials: ``admin`` / ``admin``

**📝 Development Note**: After making UI/UX changes to Vue files, you **DO NOT** need to run ``./run_all.sh`` again! The frontend uses hot reloading. Just save your files and refresh your browser. See `DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md`_ for complete details.

For detailed Docker setup instructions, see `DOCKER_README.md`_.

📺 Look and feel
----------------

Check out our `feature list`_ for more screenshots – or check the `list of
events`_ to see how imanage looks in the wild.

imanage is highly configurable, so you can change its appearance and behaviour
in many ways if the defaults don't fit your event. If the settings are not
enough for you, you can even write plugins of your own.
