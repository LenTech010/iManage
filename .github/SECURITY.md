# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Due to limited development bandwidth, only the [most recent release](https://pypi.org/project/imanage/#history) is
currently supported. If you need support for previous releases, please contact
[support@imanage.com](mailto:support@imanage.com).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Imanage, please contact [support@imanage.com](mailto:support@imanage.com). We will
respond in a timely manner. If appropriate, we will work with you on further processes/publishing and mitigation.
Since we are a small open source project, we will not be able to pay bounties, but we will acknowledge you in the
disclosure publication.
